This folder contains:
- `sentences.src`: 70 examples of "bad" sentences
- `sentences.tgt`: **paraphrased** version of the sentences in the `src` file
- `annotation.json`: result from hand-labeling the sentences (by myself), which contains:
   - spans that labels the `character`, `action`, `subject`, and `verb` of a sentence
   - multiple choices of the sentence characteristic regarding to its adherence to the five principles in the *Style* book.
